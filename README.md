# AtliQ-Hardwares-Sales-Analytics-Report

I worked on analysing AtliQ Hardware’s sales data (2019–2021) across various regions and sales channels. 

Using Excel📊, I uncovered key trends and actionable insights to help shape better business strategies.

💡 What I Discovered:-

The data revealed some extraordinary growth:

1. Sales Growth Highlights: 

- Amazon sales surged by 218.9%, while Best Buy skyrocketed with a massive 356.1% increase.
- Sales through the AtliQ Technologies e-Store grew by 223.8%, and Atlas Stores led the pack with an astonishing 470.3% growth.

2. Regional Insights:

- In the USA, sales reached an impressive $87.8M, though they fell just 11.7% short of the target.
- India showed robust growth with total sales climbing to $161.3M. These numbers highlighted both strengths and opportunities for improvement.

3. Bringing Data to Life:

- I created interactive dashboards to make complex data easy to understand for stakeholders. 
- These dashboards allowed quick access to key metrics, enabling faster, smarter decision-making.

This project was more than just a deep dive into numbers. It was an opportunity to refine my analytical and visualisation skills while contributing meaningful insights. 😉⭐
